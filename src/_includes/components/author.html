      I'm a Human-Centric Teacher and Design Engineer. I sit at the intersection of faith, design, history, and computer science. God-willing, these are the core areas of my focus for promoting human well-being and creating positive change in the world. Open web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and various web APIs are my favorite tools to enhance and amplify human efforts.

      My work fits under the umbrellas of teaching, UX research, UI design, and front-end software engineering â€” and generally thinking about humans first.
